# rsofun_doc

This repository contains the code for producing results published in Paredes et al. (2025). This study documents the rsofun package and reports results from a calibration of the P-model to GPP and traits data. A first version of the paper is published as a pre-print (see reference below). The study is currently under review at Geoscientific Model Development. Code contained in this repository serves for the revised version of the study.
